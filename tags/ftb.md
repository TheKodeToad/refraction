You cannot download FTB packs directly from Prism Launcher.

At the request of the FTB Team we had to remove the feature that allows you to download them from Prism Launcher due to the monetization of FTB packs.

Existing instances of FTB packs are still functional, however to download them, you have to use the official FTB App and manually import the modpack to your Prism Launcher instances.

For more information, please see [the blogpost](https://prismlauncher.org/news/ftb-removal/).
